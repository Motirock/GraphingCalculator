#KEY:
#
#Graph a function by adding "GRAPH:" and then the function id
#
#Function 0 is x^3-x
#Function 1 is x^0.5+x
#Function 2 is (x-2)*f0(x) or (x-2)*(x^3-x)
#Function 3 is (x/4)*f2(x) or (x/4)*((x-2)*(x^3-x))
#Function 4 is 4.5*cos(x)
#Function 5 is ((f2(x)/x)^2)^0.1 or (((x-2)*(x^3-x)/x)^2)^0.1
#Function 6 is 1.5*sin(x)/f4(x) or (1.5*sin(x))/(4.5*cos(x))
#
#To change attributes about the graph add "FLAG:" followed by the name of what you want to change.
#Flags stay in effect until they are cleared with "FLAG:CLEAR" or changed
#
#To change the color of the graphs below, add "FLAG:COLOR_ID:" and then the id of the color
#   0: red
#   1: green
#   2: blue
#   3: yellow
#   4: cyan
#   5: pink
#   6: white
#
#If you want to graph the derivative of a function, add "FLAGS:GRAPH_DERIVATIVE:n" where is n is the degree (n â‰¥ 0).
#So if you added, "FLAG:GRAPH_DERIVATIVE:3", it would graph the third degree derivative of all following functions, until it is called again or cleared.
#Be warned that the higher the degree, the laggier the application becomes as well as the return number being less accurate.
#
#To take a derivative, add "DERIVE:x,y,z", where x is the function ID, y is the location to be derived at, and z is the degree.
#This does not account for locations where the derivative doesn't exist, however.
#
#To take an integral, add "INTEGRATE:x,y,z", where x is the function ID, y is the starting value, and z is the ending value.
#Also note that integrals don't include exceptions when y aproaches 0, so taking an integral of some functions might give you an inaccurate value instead of DNE.
